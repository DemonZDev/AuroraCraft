**You are an advanced full-stack AI builder. Your task is to fully create AuroraCraft — a complete agentic AI platform that can design, generate, edit, reason about, and compile Minecraft plugins & mods. Build EVERYTHING: frontend, backend, database, session system, authentication, admin panel, file manager, Chat+Code UI, compilation pipeline, provider/model engine, token economy, and all infrastructure. Implement every component listed below exactly as written. Do not leave out ANY feature. AuroraCraft must be production-ready, scalable, secure, modern, and optimized. AuroraCraft must run on Ubuntu 25.10 or Windows.**
  
# **AURORACRAFT — FULL SYSTEM SPECIFICATION (DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING)**
 
## **1. PURPOSE OF THE PLATFORM**
 
AuroraCraft is an advanced agentic AI system specializing in:
 
 
- Creating extremely complex **Minecraft plugins** using **Java 21 & Maven**
 
- Supporting all frameworks: 
 
  - Paper, Bukkit, Spigot, Folia, Purpur
 
  - Velocity, BungeeCord, Waterfall
 
  - ASPaper, Leaves, Leaf, DivineMC, Canvas, Velocity-CTD
 

 
 
- Eventually also creating: 
 
  - **Minecraft Mods**
 
  - **Discord Bots**
 
  - **Chrome Extensions**
 
  - **Web Apps** *(Only Minecraft Plugin is selectable for now, others shown but disabled)*
 

 
 

 
The AI must:
 
 
- Think deeply, reason multiple times per step
 
- Create plans, phases, architecture
 
- View and understand files (.java, .kt, .xml, .yml, .json, .txt etc.)
 
- Manage an entire codebase
 
- Edit, generate, rename, delete files
 
- Understand code relationships
 
- Test logic
 
- Iterate reasoning
 
- Use online research
 
- Unzip & analyze uploaded projects
 
- Use memory without forgetting anything
 
- Fix compilation errors automatically
 
- Support MCP plugins
 
- Allow the user to choose AI model & provider per chat
 

  
# **2. HOMEPAGE (auroracraft.xyz)**
 
Create a beautiful eye-comfort dark theme like Codella/Kodari:
 
Homepage must contain:
 
 
- Hero title: “What should we build?”
 
- Subheader: “Create astounding plugins with no coding knowledge required”
 
- A large **chat input box** like Codella/Kodari
 
- A **Start Building** button
 
- Tabs for **Minecraft / Discord / Web** (only Minecraft active now)
 
- Stats like Codella (“9000+ plugins created”, “350M tokens used monthly”)
 
- No reptile/creature cursor — **remove this feature entirely**
 

  
# **3. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM**
 
Implement Login + Register pages:
 
**Register fields:**
 
 
- Username
 
- Email
 
- Password
 
- Confirm Password
 

 
**Features:**
 
 
- No email verification
 
- Password strength validation
 
- Store hashed passwords
 
- Create **default admin user** on first startup: 
 
  - username: admin
 
  - email: admin@auroracraft.local
 
  - password: Admin123!
 

 
 

 
Use JWT (HttpOnly cookies).
  
# **4. USER DASHBOARD / SESSIONS**
 
Users have:
 
 
- List of all chat sessions (projects)
 
- Ability to delete sessions (deletes chats, files, compile history)
 
- Token balance shown at top
 
- Token history page (enhance usage, model usage, compile usage)
 

  
# **5. CHAT INTERFACE**
 
**Modes:**
 
 
1. **Agent Mode** – AI fully creates plugin through phases & reasoning
 
2. **Plan Mode** – AI creates plugin plan, architecture, file structure
 
3. **Question Mode** – User can ask questions about implementation
 

 
**AI must:**
 
 
- Reason deeply and repeatedly
 
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
 
- Always reflect previous memory
 
- Never forget previous user messages
 
- Validate before finishing phases
 
- Stop after completing a phase and ask user to continue
 

 
**Buttons:**
 
 
- Model selector (dropdown)
 
- Mode selector
 
- Enhance button (requires login)
 
- Send button
 
- Stop button (when AI running → turns red)
 

 
**Enhance Prompt:**
 
 
- AI rewrites user prompt into an expert-level prompt
 
- Replaces text in textbox
 
- Costs tokens
